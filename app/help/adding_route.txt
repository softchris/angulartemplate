Example - adding a route:
For example you want to be able to go to a login page by typing /Login
$routeProvider.when('/Login', { templateUrl: 'html/login.html', controller: 'LoginController' });

Two things need to be created for this to work:
- Create the view:  html/login.html.
- Create the controller in controllers.js
Creating a controller is done by first getting an instance of the correct module and then creation of
the actual controller see 'help/adding_a_controller':
